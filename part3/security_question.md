According to the OWASP Top 10 for 2021 the what I look for to make the system secure would be:

### Injection Attacks:

- Ensure that your Python backend code is not susceptible to SQL injection by using parameterized queries or an Object Relational Mapping (ORM) framework to interact with the MySQL database.
- Perform input validation and sanitation to prevent other forms of injection attacks, such as command injection.


### Broken Authentication:

- Implement strong authentication mechanisms for both the mobile app and web frontend, including multi-factor authentication (MFA) if possible.
- Enforce proper session management, token expiration, and password policies.


### Sensitive Data Exposure:

- Encrypt important data in transit and at rest using strong encryption algorithms. Secure data stored in the MySQL database, including customer passwords.
- Apply access controls to restrict access to important information. Minimize access to customer support employees and sales employees.


### XML External Entity Attacks:

- Ensure XML parsing in the backend is configured securely to prevent XXE attacks.
- Disable or restrict external entity references in XML documents.


### Broken Access Control:

- Implement proper access control for different user roles to ensure that they only have access to the resources and actions they need.
- Enforce least privilege principles to limit employee access.


### Security Misconfigurations:

- Regularly audit your Kubernetes configuration, ensuring that only necessary ports and services are exposed.
- Keep software libraries, frameworks, and dependencies up-to-date.
- Implement proper error handling to avoid leaking sensitive information in error messages.


### Cross-Site Scripting Attacks:

- Clean user inputs and implement output encoding in the web frontend to prevent XSS attacks.
- Use security headers to mitigate the risk of XSS.


### Insecure Deserialization:

- Be cautious about deserializing untrusted data. Implement input validation and consider alternatives to insecure deserialization.
- Use strong authentication and authorization to protect against this type of attack.


### Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities:

- Regularly monitor and update all software components, libraries, and dependencies used in your infrastructure, including the Kubernetes containers.
- Subscribe to security alerts and advisories for the technologies you employ.


### Insufficient Logging & Monitoring:

- Set up comprehensive logging and monitoring for your infrastructure to detect and respond to security incidents.
- Establish an incident response plan and ensure that your team is well-prepared to react to security breaches.
